# Auto-CECFDST-model
The file is a plugin developed by Python language and ABAQUS software to generate FE models of CECFDST structures automatically, incorporating source code for the parametric modeling process. Only the basic geometric and physical parameters of the structures need to be input for automated modeling. The file could be downloaded to the "abaqus_plugins" folder on the computer to create an ABAQUS plugin. The modeling approach offers a convenient method for batch modeling in multi-parameter coupling studies of CECFDST structures, with material constitutive relationships and modeling details to be elaborated in related papers.

Notes: The plugin was developed based on ABAQUS 2022. Please ensure compatibility with the software version during use.
